# On-Chain-Propaganda

## What for?
Educational + Fun Pictures that Community Members can pay attention to and engage with

## Say More?
To propagandize the on-chain world for world domination. Just kidding, it's really a tool that helps community members do their own due diligence, help learn and teach others about basic on-chain safety and market dynamics all the while creating community engagement.

## Potential Use Cases
1) Check to see if a project is a legitimate project or not
2) Check on market dynamics and see predictive analytics of the community's token
3) Just make some propaganda for your community


## What community Want/Need?
Something fun that grabs their attention while being easy to engage + Slipping in quick bits of knowledge doesn't hurt. Sort of like mixing bitter medicine with something sweet to make it taste better :)
