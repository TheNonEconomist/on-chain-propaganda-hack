# On-Chain-Propaganda

## What for?
To propagandize the on-chain world for world domination. Just kidding, it's really to distribute bunch of educational and fun materials to on-chain communities.

## Why?
Cuz so much of education is really boilerplate and could be automated. Also adding custom messages disguised as a propaganda for your community could be fun way for community members to engage with one another

## How does it work?
Grab a character that represents your community, choose what kind of lessons or messages you'd like to communicate to your community, and let a TG bot do your job!
